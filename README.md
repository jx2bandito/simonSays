# Simon<br />


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the last project for the FreeCodeCamp Front-End Developer course. For the design,
 I made it similar to the physical version of the game, but at the same time I included features available 
 to web pages. I added a new option called "Nightmare". When activating Nightmare, the Simon game spins around and
 loses its colors. In addition to the CPU sequence steadily getting faster, every so often the Simon game will spin again.
 Note that Strict and Nightmare mode cannot be toggled if a game is in progress.
